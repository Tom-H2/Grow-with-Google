			<p>Taken to the brink of extinction due to thinning egg shells caused by DDT, Peregrin falcons have made a remarkable recovery in recent decades. These raptors hunt almost exclusively by diving at their prey and hitting them in mid-air. Their pointed wings and long narrow tail distinguishes them from most other hawks as does their distinctive rounded dark bar below the eyes.</p>
